    "    * A coil order can be built from only one slab.\n",
    "    * Each coil order requires a specific process to build it from a slab. This process is encoded by a color.\n",

    "Prescriptive analytics (decision optimization) technology recommends actions that are based on desired outcomes. It considers specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control over business outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle a future situation. Organizations that act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.\n",

    "With prescriptive analytics, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automate the complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage your limited resources.\n",
