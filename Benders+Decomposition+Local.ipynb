    "\n",
    "Benders decomposition is an approach to solve mathematical programming problems with a decomposable structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with 12.7, CPLEX can decompose the model into a single master and (possibly multiple) subproblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, CPLEX can use annotations that you supply for your model or automatically do the decomposition. \n",
    "This approach can be applied to mixed-integer linear programs (MILP). For certain types of problems, this approach can offer significant performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "If your problem does not match such decomposition, CPLEX will raise an error at solve time.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPLEX will produce an error `CPXERR_BAD_DECOMPOSITION` if the annotated decomposition does not yield disjoint subproblems"

    "## How  decision optimization can help\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics (decision optimization) technology recommends actions that are based on desired outcomes. It considers specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control over business outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes. Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle a future situation. Organizations that act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "With prescriptive analytics, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automate the complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage your limited resources.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n",
